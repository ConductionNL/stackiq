/**
 * Re-points this app's OpenRegister SCHEMAS at the new application id.
 *
 * A DIFFERENT COLUMN FROM RenameDutchSchemaSlugs, AND NEITHER COVERS THE
 * OTHER: that step rewrites `openregister_schemas.slug`, this one rewrites
 * `openregister_schemas.application`. A register-slug rename would not cover
 * it either. OpenRegister resolves the two halves of a configuration by
 * DIFFERENT keys:
 *
 *   - a REGISTER by slug alone      -> RegisterMapper::find(slug)
 *   - a SCHEMA by the PAIR          -> SchemaMapper::findByApplicationAndSlug(slug, application)
 *
 * `SettingsService` passes `appId: Application::APP_ID`, which is now
 * `stackiq`. Every schema this app already owns still carries
 * `application = 'softwarecatalog'`, so the pair matches nothing — and
 * ImportHandler's not-found branch is not an error path, it is the "create a
 * new one" path. The next import therefore builds a SECOND, EMPTY set of
 * schemas under the new application id while every stored object stays bound
 * to the old ones. Nothing errors. The app renders empty collections.
 *
 * Measured on a live install before this step existed: 21 schemas still under
 * `softwarecatalog` and zero under `stackiq`, none of them colliding with a
 * twin under the new id — so all 21 move cleanly. The gap is fleet-wide, not
 * specific to one app: 231 under `docudesk`, 200 under `openconnector`, 180
 * under `procest`, 98 under `decidesk`, 17 under `openbuild`.
 *
 * RUNS AFTER RenameDutchSchemaSlugs AND BEFORE InitializeSettings. After the
 * slug rename so the collision check is judged against the slugs the rows will
 * actually carry; before InitializeSettings because that is what triggers the
 * register import via SettingsService::initialize().
 *
 * IT REFUSES RATHER THAN MERGES. Where a schema slug ALREADY has a twin under
 * the new application id, the fork has happened: re-pointing would leave two
 * rows sharing (application, slug), and findByApplicationAndSlug() caps at one
 * row — so one of them silently wins every lookup and the other's objects
 * become unreachable. Choosing between them is a decision about data, not a
 * migration, so this step logs and leaves both alone. Measured: integriq has
 * 200 such collisions, planninq and larpinq 2 each.
 *
 * IT NEVER DELETES A SCHEMA, and it never throws — it runs under `<install>`,
 * where an escaping exception aborts the install and the app never enables.
