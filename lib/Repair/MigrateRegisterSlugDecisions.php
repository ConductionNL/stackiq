	 * Decide which register slugs may be renamed, given what the install holds.
	 *
	 * Three outcomes, and the difference between them matters:
	 *
	 * - the OLD slug is absent — nothing to do. Either this install never had
	 *   the register, or a previous run already renamed it. Not a refusal, and
	 *   this is what makes the step idempotent.
	 * - the NEW slug is ALREADY present alongside the old one — refuse, and
	 *   rename neither. OpenRegister resolves a register by slug and caps the
	 *   lookup at one row ordered by id, so two rows sharing a slug means the
	 *   lower id silently wins every lookup. Merging two registers is a decision
	 *   about data, not a rename, and a repair step must not take it.
	 * - otherwise — rename.
	 *
	 * The `$existing` set is updated as it goes, so a rename earlier in the map
	 * is visible to the collision check of a later one; otherwise two entries
	 * targeting the same name would both look safe.

	 *
