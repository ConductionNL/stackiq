/**
 * Stackiq SetupController.
 *
 * The ADR-042 first-time setup contract, in its smallest honest form:
 *
 *   GET  /api/setup/status            per-step state
 *   POST /api/setup/action/{actionId} run a privileged server-side action
 *
 * This app declares no configuration of its own yet, so the wizard orients and
 * offers the demo data the app ALREADY ships — a dataset generated from its own
 * schemas that no operator could previously reach. It deliberately does not
 * invent configuration steps: a wizard that asks questions the app does not act
 * on is worse than none.
