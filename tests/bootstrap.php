// conduction/hydra-gates claims `OCA\OpenRegister\Contract\` as a RUNTIME psr-4
// prefix, so consumers get these interfaces implicitly. That prefix is LONGER
// than openregister's own `OCA\OpenRegister\` -> `lib/`, and PSR-4 is
// longest-prefix-wins, so whichever app's autoloader registers first defines
// OpenRegister's contract for the whole process (ConductionNL/.github#531).
//
// Loaded here, immediately after the autoloader and before the OpenRegister
// stubs below, for the same reason those stubs are loaded early: what is
// declared first wins, and the contract must exist before anything implementing
// it is declared.
//
// interface_exists() is order-independent — it asks whether the interface is
// RESOLVABLE, not who registered first. Appending a fallback autoloader does
// NOT work: spl_autoload_register appends relative to registration order, and
// that order across independently loaded apps is what nobody controls.

// tests use the explicit stub in tests/Stubs/. It is loaded HERE, BEFORE
// Nextcloud's app bootstrap, so the stub class wins over the real OR class
// when PHPUnit later resolves `OCA\OpenRegister\Db\ObjectEntity` for mock
// generation. We do NOT use a composer `autoload-dev` PSR-4 mapping for the
// foreign `OCA\OpenRegister\` namespace — that would shadow the real
// OpenRegister classes in any deployment whose vendor/ retains dev autoload
// entries (breaking every OR-backed app, see PR #232 / issue #230).

 * Tell whether a Nextcloud root is an INSTALLED instance, not just a source tree.
 *
 * `lib/base.php` from a source tree that was never installed (the workspace
 * checkout above apps-extra/ has a 0-byte config/config.php) still declares
 * `OC` and builds `\OC::$server` before it throws "Not installed". That server
 * cannot be undone (`OC::$server` is a typed static), so from then on every
 * `\OC::$server->get()` in the code under test hits a container that knows
 * none of this app's registrations and autowires from scratch; constructor
 * cycles then recurse until memory runs out (19 GB and 6 GB of swap in one
 * openregister run on 2026-09-08). So the decision has to be made BEFORE
 * base.php is loaded, and the only cheap signal is the `installed` flag in
 * config/config.php.

 *
 * @return bool True when config/config.php declares `installed => true`.
