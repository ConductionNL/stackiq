/**
 * Two-route boot smoke check — gates the expensive e2e run on a cheap one.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * A Vue 3 bundle can fail to boot while every other gate stays green. The known
 * case: `@nextcloud/l10n` v2 against nc-vue's pre-bundled dialogs, which call the
 * v3-only `getGettextBuilder().detectLanguage()`. That throws at import time and
 * leaves an EMPTY SHELL on every route — npm, ESLint, webpack and a byte-verified
 * deploy were all clean, and 37 minutes of e2e ran against a bundle that never
 * booted before a browser finally caught it.
 *
 * So this asserts the app MOUNTED, not that the server returned 200:
 *   - the app's own host element exists AND rendered real child content;
 *   - CnAppRoot did not render "Required apps are missing" — what a MISSING
 *     DEPENDENCY APP looks like. It does not error; it produces a plausible wall
 *     of red across the whole suite for a reason unrelated to the code.
 *   - no fatal page/console error was raised.
 *
 * ⚠️ This is a Playwright PROJECT rather than a standalone node script on
 * purpose. A standalone script has to solve authentication itself, and the
 * committed `tests/e2e/.auth/admin.json` is a dead session against whatever
 * instance last generated it — an unauthenticated load returns **401**, whose
 * symptom (`#stackiq` absent, ZERO js errors) is indistinguishable at a
 * glance from a genuinely dead bundle. Running as a project reuses
 * `globalSetup`, which logs in fresh against the configured base URL.
 *
 * Run:  npx playwright test --project smoke
