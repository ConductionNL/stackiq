 * CI regression config for the shared `E2E Tests (Playwright)` job.
 *
 * WHY A SECOND CONFIG EXISTS
 * --------------------------
 * The shared workflow (ConductionNL/.github/.github/workflows/quality.yml)
 * runs the suite as:
 *
 *     CONFIG="${{ inputs.playwright-test-path }}/playwright.config.ts"
 *     if [ ! -f "$CONFIG" ] && [ -f "playwright.config.ts" ]; then
 *       CONFIG="playwright.config.ts"
 *     fi
 *     npx playwright test --config="$CONFIG"
 *
 * Note what is missing: `--project`. So whichever config it picks, EVERY
 * project in it runs. The root `playwright.config.ts` declares three:
 *
 *   smoke    — two-route boot check (tests/e2e/smoke/app-mounts.spec.ts).
 *   chromium — the regression suite. This is the one CI wants.
 *   visual   — pixel-diff baselines. Its own header says the committed PNGs
 *              are host-font/GPU specific and "a CI Linux runner will not
 *              byte-match a dev-container baseline", so it CANNOT pass here.
 *
 * Letting the root config be picked would therefore run a project documented
 * as unable to pass on a CI runner. Rather than delete or weaken `visual`,
 * `playwright-test-path: tests/e2e` in the caller makes the workflow's FIRST
 * config lookup hit this file. The root config is untouched and stays the
 * entry point for local runs and `--project visual`.
 *
 * WHY `smoke` IS KEPT IN CI (a deliberate choice, not a copy)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------
 * It is two tests and a few seconds, and it is the only thing in the suite
 * that distinguishes "the bundle never mounted" from "the product is broken".
 * A Vue 3 bundle that throws at import time produces an empty shell on every
 * route — which surfaces as ~50 selector timeouts that all read like product
 * defects. Projects run in declaration order under `workers: 1`, so smoke
 * runs first and labels that failure mode before the regression suite spends
 * the budget reproducing it 50 times. The `chromium` project's testIgnore
 * excludes the smoke directory, so nothing runs twice.
 *
 * (Deliberately spelled out in prose: a glob written literally here would
 * contain the `*` + `/` sequence that CLOSES this block comment, which turns
 * the remaining prose into executable code. That is exactly how the first
 * version of this file died — `ReferenceError: smoke is not defined`.)
 *
 * The report/output paths differ from the root config deliberately: the
 * workflow uploads `server/apps/softwarecatalog/playwright-report/` and
 * `server/apps/softwarecatalog/test-results/`, so on CI the artefacts must
 * land at the APP ROOT. The root config's bare `reporter: 'list'` produces no
 * HTML report at all, which would make the upload step silently attach an
 * empty artifact (`if-no-files-found: ignore`) — a failing run with nothing
 * to read.
