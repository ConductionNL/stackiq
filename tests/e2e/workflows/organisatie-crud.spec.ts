/**
 * DEEP, data-dependent persistence workflow for the ORGANISATION entity, driven
 * through the `/organisaties` index. That page is a standard manifest
 * `type: index` (CnIndexPage rendering OrganisatieCard as its card component);
 * it used to be a bespoke `type: custom` OrganisatieIndexView and this file
 * still described that removed surface, which is why three of its assertions
 * named strings the product no longer renders.
 *
 * What is proven through the UI:
 *   - read-persistence: an organisation SEEDED via the OpenRegister API
 *     RENDERS as a real card in the index (NOT the "No items found"
 *     empty-state) — direct proof the list fetches a real register (the
 *     `@resolve` sentinel) AND that the page's `config.filter` still selects
 *     values the rows can actually hold;
 *   - the seeded card shows the organisation's name + type;
 *   - the primary create action opens the create dialog.
 *
 * What is NOT verified here: see the `test.fixme` at the bottom — its old
 * reason (an ObjectModal Catalogus cascade) describes a surface that no longer
 * exists, and the leg has not been re-authored against the dialog that replaced
 * it. (Create + cleanup are exercised here via the OR API instead.)
 *
 * Cleanup: the seeded org carries the RUN_ID token; afterAll deletes it via the
 * OR deleteObject verb.

// affordance opens the legacy ObjectModal whose first step is a Catalogus ->
// Register -> Schema cascade that cannot resolve in a dev container with no
// catalog object. That surface is gone: src/manifest.json decomposed the
// bespoke OrganisatieIndexView into a standard `type: index` page, so the
// create action opens nc-vue's CnIndexPage form dialog, which is already bound
// to the register and schema from the page config and asks for no cascade at
// all — as the sibling test above records, and as a running instance confirms
// (the dialog opens on "Create Organisation" with the schema's own fields and
// a disabled Create button until the required ones are filled).
//
// So this leg is NOT blocked. It is UNVERIFIED: the body below still drives the
// removed cascade and has never been re-authored against the dialog the product
// actually renders, and the assertion it ends on ("the new card appears by
// name") cannot simply be ported, because which fields the dialog exposes is
// governed by the schema's own `visible` flags and that has to be measured
// against the CI instance rather than guessed.
//
// Recorded on the fleet board for an owner. It is deliberately NOT dressed up
// as an environment gap again — a skip whose stated reason is false reads
// exactly like a passing test, and this one hid the fact that the whole create
