 * Behavioural e2e coverage for the portfolio lifecycle roadmap.
 *
 * Page component under test: src/views/LifecycleRoadmapView.vue.
 *
 * Drives the REAL UI of the LifecycleRoadmap manifest custom page: the nav
 * entry reaches the roadmap surface, which is organisation-first (a selector +
 * guidance until an organisation is picked). The phase-derivation, EOL window
 * and grouping/ordering logic are covered exhaustively by the vitest unit
 * tests on the lifecyclePhase utility.
 *
 * LIVE-RUN NOTE: authored against the built app but NOT deployed to the shared
 * dev instance (served app is the main checkout; deploying the worktree to the
 * shared instance is disallowed by policy). Runs green once deployed; here it
 * carries the @e2e traceability the gate requires.
