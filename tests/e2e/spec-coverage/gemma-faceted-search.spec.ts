 * Behavioural e2e coverage for GEMMA faceted search.
 *
 * Surfaces under test:
 *   lib/Controller/FacetController.php   GET /api/facets/{schema}
 *   lib/Service/FacetService.php         aggregation + per-caller cache
 *   src/views/FacetedCatalogIndexView.vue  manifest pages `Modules` (/modules)
 *                                          and `Diensten` (/diensten)
 *
 * ⚠️ SCOPE OF THIS FILE — READ BEFORE ADDING TO IT.
 *
 * The scenarios about facet VALUES (counts per referentiecomponent, OR-within-
 * a-dimension, AND-across-dimensions, URL round-tripping of a selection, saved
 * views) are NOT covered here, and not because they are hard: the fixtures
 * cannot be built through the object API. Measured on a live instance —
 * POSTing a module with
 *     {"standardVersions":["StUF-ZKN-x"],"referenceComponents":["RC-x"]}
 * returns 200 with BOTH arrays silently emptied (`"standardVersions":[]`,
 * `"referenceComponents":[]`). They are relation fields; OpenRegister drops
 * bare strings without erroring. Seeding them needs real `element` objects in
 * the AMEF register plus `relation` rows, which is a fixture layer this file
 * deliberately does not fake — a facet test seeded with data the product
 * cannot produce would prove nothing.
 *
 * So this file covers the facet CONTRACT and the panel's presence, and leaves
 * the value-dependent scenarios uncovered and counted. That is the honest
 * split; see the PR for the two scenarios that are unimplemented outright.

// which degrades to a NULL cache when Nextcloud has no memcache backend
// configured — nothing is stored and `_meta.cached` is therefore always false.
//
// Measured on both sides:
//   dev rig  — `occ config:system:get memcache.local` -> \OC\Memcache\APCu,
//              APCu present; the flag flips false -> true reliably.
//   CI       — the shared workflow configures no memcache at all (zero
//              mentions of memcache/apcu in the job log); both calls returned
//              `cached: false` and the assertion failed on the first run and
//              its retry.
//
// So on the instance where this suite actually runs, the scenario has no
// observable behaviour. The tempting fixes are both wrong: a `test.skip` guard
// on "is caching available" would never be false on CI, so it would credit
// coverage that never executes; and asserting only that `cached` is a boolean
// is an assertion that cannot fail. Left uncovered and counted until the CI
// instance configures a cache backend.
