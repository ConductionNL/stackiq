 * ADR-111 — the demo-data setup step, exercised against a running instance.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The programme that added demo data to this fleet shipped a
 * defect that every unit test passed: the import printed `register "…"
 * imported.` and seeded ZERO of the descriptor's objects. The unit tests could
 * not see it — they mock the import service, so they validate the CALL and
 * never its effect.
 *
 * So the assertion that matters here is not "the endpoint answers 200". It is
 * that the response NAMES WHAT LANDED. A success message that cannot be told
 * apart from an import that wrote nothing is exactly what let that defect
 * through.
 *
 * WHY THE API AND NOT A CLICK-THROUGH. `CnAppRoot` opens the optional wizard
 * only while an optional step is outstanding, and the CI seed deliberately
 * settles those so the wizard stops covering the app in every test. The
 * observable surface for this capability is therefore the contract the wizard
 * calls — `GET /api/setup/status` and `POST /api/setup/action/{id}` — issued
 * from inside the authenticated admin page so every call carries the real
 * session and `OC.requestToken` through Nextcloud's `AuthorizedAdminSetting`
 * middleware. A unit test with a mocked IAppConfig cannot show that middleware
 * admitting the request; this can — and that middleware is precisely what the
 * attribute on SetupController configures.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT ASSERT. That the demo-data step is FIRST
 * (ADR-111 rule 4) is a property of the manifest, which the app bundles rather
 * than serves, so it is not observable from here. Gate 100
 * (`setup-demo-data-first`) checks it statically on every change. Claiming to
 * prove it here would be asserting something this vantage point cannot see.
 *
 * @spec exclude ADR-042/ADR-111 setup contract; no per-app behavioural spec.

 * is a choice followed by a load step now, and the CI seed settles the optional
 * steps by posting `skip-demo-data` — which records "none". A load that follows
 * correctly imports nothing, so an install test that skips this arranges no
 * precondition and measures the seed instead of the app.
 *
 * The id comes from `/api/setup/status` rather than a literal: the choice step
 * reads its options from exactly that list, so a hardcoded id can pass while
