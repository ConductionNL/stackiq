# Provision Stackiq's OpenRegister registers + schemas on a freshly
# installed Nextcloud, for the shared `E2E Tests (Playwright)` CI job.
#
# Wired up as the workflow's `playwright-seed-command`. That step runs AFTER
# `php -S` is up and with cwd set to the Nextcloud server root, so this is
# invoked as:
#
#     playwright-seed-command: 'bash apps/stackiq/tests/e2e/ci-seed.sh'
#
# WHY THIS IS NEEDED
# ------------------
# `occ app:enable stackiq` runs the `InitializeSettings` post-migration
# repair step, which is supposed to import `lib/Settings/softwarecatalogus_register.json`
# into OpenRegister. Two things make that unreliable as the sole fresh-install
# path, and BOTH fail silently:
#
#   1. An IRepairStep runs with NO user session. OpenRegister's RBAC evaluates
#      the acting user, so the import can be denied outright — and
#      `InitializeSettings::run()` catches `\Exception` and downgrades it to a
#      warning. `occ app:enable` still exits 0.
#   2. The non-forced import path is version-guarded: it can advance the
#      recorded configuration version WITHOUT applying the register, so a
#      second run then sees "already current" and does nothing either.
#
# Either way the app enables cleanly, the SPA boots, and the `voorzieningen`
# register simply is not there. The e2e suite's failure mode in that state is a
# wall of `voorzieningen/config returned 500` / `voorzieningen register not
# configured` — messages that point at the fixtures, not at the missing import.
#
# So this script does the import EXPLICITLY through the admin HTTP API (which
# has a real session and passes RBAC), with `force: true` to defeat the version
# guard, and then VERIFIES the registers, the schemas, AND the app-level
# register/schema mapping the fixtures actually resolve by. A failed provision
# becomes one loud step failure here instead of ~20 misleading spec failures.
#
# It is idempotent: the import is idempotent server-side, and re-running only
# re-verifies.

# ── Target resolution ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# ADMIN_USER / ADMIN_PASSWORD, but accept the runner's own `php -S 0.0.0.0:8080`

#
# That fallback is gated on actually being in CI. On a developer box
# `localhost:8080` is the SHARED dev container, and this script performs ADMIN
# WRITES with `force: true` — it must never silently reimport a register into

# ── 3b. The AMEF register: resolve it, PROBE IT, and give it rows ────────────
# The Standaarden / StandaardDetail manifest pages read `schema: element`, which
# lib/Settings/softwarecatalogus_register.json attaches to the `vng-gemma` (AMEF)
# register and NOT to the catalog register `stackiq`. They resolve it through the
# `@resolve:amef_register` sentinel that lib/AppInfo/Application.php::boot()
# provisions from the `amef_config` blob.
#
# ⚠️ THE CHECK ABOVE CANNOT CATCH THE FAILURE THIS ONE EXISTS FOR. Verifying that
# a schema slug is PRESENT in /api/schemas is a different question from whether it
# is ATTACHED to the register you are about to address, and only the second one
# decides whether /api/objects/{register}/{schema} answers. OpenRegister used to
# fall back to a global slug lookup on a scoped miss; since 2026-08-16 it throws,
# so an unattached slug returns `404 {"message":"Schema not found: 'element'"}`.
# The only honest probe is the request the page itself makes — so we make it.
#
# And a 200 is still not enough. An empty list renders as a legitimate "No items
# found", i.e. a page that is broken and quiet looks exactly like a page that is
# healthy and unpopulated. GEMMA elements normally arrive via the ArchiMate import
# of a multi-megabyte GEMMA_release.xml, which no CI job runs, so we seed two
# `element` fixtures here — one `gemmaType: standaard` (which the page MUST list)
# and one `gemmaType: referentiecomponent` (which it must NOT). The pair makes the
# page's own `filter.gemmaType` falsifiable in both directions.
