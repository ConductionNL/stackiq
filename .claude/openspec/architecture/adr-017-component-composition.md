# ADR-017: Component Composition Rules

## Status
Accepted

## Date

## Context

Conduction apps share a Vue component library (`@conduction/nextcloud-vue`) that provides self-contained, higher-level components like `CnObjectDataWidget`, `CnStatsPanel`, `CnDetailPage`, and `CnTimelineStages`. These components internally render their own card wrappers (`CnDetailCard`), headers, and layout containers.

Developers have been wrapping these self-contained components inside additional layout containers (e.g. `CnDetailCard` wrapping `CnObjectDataWidget`), producing a "card-in-card" visual artifact where headers and borders are doubled. This was found across Procest, Pipelinq, and earlier OpenCatalogi iterations.

The same principle applies to `CnDetailPage` which renders its own `NcAppContent` wrapper — apps must not add another `NcAppContent` around it.

## Decision

### Self-contained components render their own container

The following components are **self-contained** and MUST NOT be wrapped in `CnDetailCard`, `NcAppContent`, or other layout containers:

| Component | Renders its own | Use directly inside |
|---|---|---|
| `CnObjectDataWidget` | `CnDetailCard` | `CnDetailPage` slot, `<div>`, or grid cell |
| `CnObjectMetadataWidget` | `CnDetailCard` | `CnDetailPage` slot, `<div>`, or grid cell |
| `CnStatsPanel` | Sections with headers | `CnDetailPage` slot or `<div>` |
| `CnDetailPage` | `NcAppContent`-level layout | Directly in `<router-view>` |
| `CnDashboardPage` | `NcAppContent`-level layout | Directly in `<router-view>` |
| `CnIndexPage` | `NcAppContent`-level layout | Directly in `<router-view>` |
| `CnTimelineStages` | Standalone timeline | Inside `CnDetailCard` or any container (no own card) |

### How to identify self-contained components

A component is self-contained if its template root is a card, panel, or page-level wrapper. Check the component source: if it starts with `<CnDetailCard>`, `<div class="cn-*-card">`, or similar, it manages its own container.

### Correct patterns

```vue
<!-- CORRECT: CnObjectDataWidget renders its own card -->
<CnObjectDataWidget
  :schema="schema"
  :object-data="data"
  title="Case Information" />

<!-- CORRECT: CnTimelineStages is NOT self-contained, wrap it -->
<CnDetailCard :title="t('app', 'Status')">
  <CnTimelineStages :stages="stages" :current-stage="current" />
</CnDetailCard>
```

### Anti-patterns

```vue
<!-- WRONG: Double card wrapping -->
<CnDetailCard :title="t('app', 'Case Information')">
  <CnObjectDataWidget :schema="schema" :object-data="data" />
</CnDetailCard>

<!-- WRONG: Double page wrapping -->
<NcAppContent>
  <CnDetailPage :title="title">...</CnDetailPage>
</NcAppContent>
```

### External sidebar pattern

Components like `CnDetailPage` that support sidebars communicate with a parent-provided `objectSidebarState` via Vue's `provide`/`inject`. The sidebar component (`CnObjectSidebar`) MUST be rendered at the `NcContent` level in `App.vue`, NOT inside `NcAppContent`:

```vue
<!-- App.vue -->
<NcContent app-name="myapp">
  <MainMenu />
  <NcAppContent>
    <router-view />
  </NcAppContent>
  <CnObjectSidebar v-if="objectSidebarState.active" ... />
</NcContent>
```

## Consequences

- Developers must check if a shared component is self-contained before wrapping it
- The component library documents which components are self-contained in their JSDoc headers
- Code reviews should flag card-in-card nesting as a pattern violation
- Existing violations should be fixed when encountered (per ADR-015 pre-existing issues rule)
